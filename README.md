# PowerBI_Project-Credit-Card-Report

The project involves creating a Credit Card Transaction Report using PostgreSQL for the database management and Power BI for the data visualization. Hereâ€™s a detailed breakdown of the project based on the contents of the report:

1. Database Design and Data Processing (PostgreSQL)
The data is likely managed in PostgreSQL, using SQL queries to extract relevant information on credit card transactions, including details on:

Revenue: Total revenue generated through different types of expenditures such as bills, groceries, entertainment, etc.
Transaction counts: Number of transactions categorized by expenditure type and customer demographic information.
Interest Earned: Calculations of the interest earned per card category and customer type.
Customer Information: This includes fields like education level, job status, income group, dependent count, and card category (Blue, Silver, Gold, Platinum).
Customer Segmentation: Segmentation based on demographics such as age group, income level, education, and job type.
The SQL file CreaditCardDetails.sql likely contains queries for extracting and aggregating this data, possibly from a relational database of credit card transactions.

2. Data Visualization (Power BI)
The data extracted from PostgreSQL is then visualized in Power BI to create detailed reports on various aspects of the credit card transactions:

Revenue and Transaction Overview:

Revenue and transaction count per quarter (Q1, Q2, Q3, Q4).
Overall revenue by card categories (Blue, Silver, Gold, Platinum).
Expenditure Type Analysis:

Revenue by different expenditure types: bills, entertainment, fuel, grocery, food, travel, etc.
Customer Demographics:

Revenue segmented by educational level (Graduate, High School, Post-Graduate, etc.).
Revenue by job type (Businessman, Government employee, Blue-collar, White-collar, Self-employed, Retirees).
Revenue breakdown by income group (Low, Medium, Unknown).
Average number of customers based on gender and card category.
Transaction Details:

Payment method analysis (swipe, chip, online).
Revenue and transaction amount by customer segments and their preferences.
Time-Based Trends:

Revenue trends visualized over specific periods (Year, Month, Day).
Gender-based transaction behavior over time.
Customer Satisfaction:

A satisfaction score of 3.19 based on some customer feedback or survey results.
Revenue Breakdown:

Revenue visualization based on age group and gender over time (e.g., 20-30, 30-40, 40-50, etc.).
This project offers both financial insights and customer behavior analytics, 
which could be useful for optimizing credit card offerings, enhancing customer satisfaction, and targeting specific customer segments.
